# Cooking Recipe Finder

A modern React web app that helps you find possible dishes based on the ingredients you have. This app uses a local `full_format_recipes.json` file as its recipe database, so no API key is needed.

- Select ingredients from a visual list
- See possible dishes you can make
- Click a recipe to view full details (ingredients, instructions, etc.) in a popup modal
- Add and remove ingredients dynamically
- Enjoy a smooth, animated user experience

## Features
- **Ingredient Selection:** Choose ingredients and see matching dishes in real time.
- **Minimal Recipe List:** The main page shows only recipe titles (and images if available) for a clean overview.
- **Full Details on Click:** Click a recipe to view all details (ingredients, instructions, etc.) in a modal popup.
- **Dynamic UI:** Selected ingredients are shown as chips and removed from the available list until deselected.
- **Responsive Design:** Works well on desktop and mobile.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v14 or newer recommended)
- npm or yarn

### Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cooking-recipe-finder.git
   cd cooking-recipe-finder
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   ```
3. **Recipe Database Not Included:**
   The main recipe database file (`src/full_format_recipes.json`) is **not included** in this repository due to size and/or licensing restrictions.
   - You must provide your own `full_format_recipes.json` file in the `src/` directory for the app to work.
   - See the [Database Format](#database-format) section below for details.

4. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   # or
   yarn start
   ```
   The app will open at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Usage
- Select ingredients from the list.
- View possible dishes under "Possible Dishes".
- Click a dish card to view recipe details in a popup.
- Remove ingredients by clicking the Ã— on a chip.

## Database Format
- The app expects a file named `full_format_recipes.json` in the `src/` directory.
- This file should be an array of recipe objects, each with at least the following fields:
  - `title` (string): The name of the recipe
  - `ingredients` (array of strings): List of ingredients
  - `instructions` (array of strings): Step-by-step instructions
  - `image` (string, optional): URL or path to an image
- Example entry:
  ```json
  {
    "title": "Lentil Soup",
    "ingredients": ["Lentils", "Carrots", "Onion", "Celery", "Spices"],
    "instructions": ["Chop vegetables.", "Simmer with lentils.", "Serve hot."]
  }
  ```
- You can use your own dataset, or export/download a compatible one from a recipe API or open data source.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
